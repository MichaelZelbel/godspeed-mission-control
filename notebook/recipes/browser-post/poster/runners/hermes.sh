# Runner: a Hermes profile, once, for one Planino browser posting job.
#
# Called by wake.js with the job id as $1 and these in the environment:
#   JOB_ID, JOB_PLATFORM, PLANINO_POSTER_URL, PLANINO_POSTER_TOKEN, BRIDGE_URL
# The posting rules and playbooks ship in this kit (poster/skill/SKILL.md, poster/playbooks/).
# Knobs (poster.env): HERMES_PROFILE, HERMES_BIN, HERMES_WORKDIR (the directory
# whose AGENTS.md and skills the profile should load; Hermes reads them from
# the current directory).
#
# A Hermes one-shot run loads no MCP servers, so the skill's HTTP path is the
# one this runner relies on: the poster API with curl, the bridge with curl.
